# Project: IMD5 Clone 
In this chapter, you'll apply everything that you've learned towards builing your first project: A clone of IMDB using the OMDb API. 

## Objectives 
We've defined the following objectives: 

students will... 

1. [build a landing page][1]
2. [submit an AJAX call][2]
3. [display a list of movies][3]
4. [display a movie][4]
5. [push their work to Github][5]

### 1 of 5: A Landing Page
This will be the first page that a user visits. On this page, you should have a form that accepts the title of a movie. 

### 2 of 5: An AJAX Call
When a user submits a form with a title of a movie, an AJAX call should be made to the [OMDb API][21]. We want to receive JSON from the call.  

### 3 of 5: Lots of Movies
The JSON we receive should contain a list of movies with a title that contains the title submitted in the form. This list will contain unformatted JSON. In other words, the data will be hard to read. To fix this problem, you can use a [JSON Formatter][31].

### 4 of 5: A Movie
When viewing a list of movies, we should be able to view the details of a specific movie. When we double-click a movie, create the behavior to submit an AJAX call for the details of that specific movie. Then display those details. 

### 5 of 5: Push to Github
When you're ready to share you're amazing code, please follow these instructions: 

1. Inside of `_06_imdb-clone/your-solution`, please create a folder with the following naming convention: [lastName-firstName].  
2. Add your project to this folder. 
3. Push your code to your fork of this repository.
4. Submit a pull request. 

# Conclusion
You've built a project with the knowledge you've acquired. You should be extremely proud of yourself; you've accomplished a lot and you've revealed some of the mysterious associated with building a web-based application. We're excited to reveal more of these mysterious and see you wield the power of web development to build amazing things.
