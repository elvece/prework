# Chapter 4: JavaScript
We believe that the best introduction to JavaScript involves engaging material that is scoped well and involves code. The resources that appeared immediately into our minds were Code School and Code Academy. Both use interactive consoles that ask users to write code and then provide those users with immediate feedback. What's not to love? 

Well, both resources are great at introducing some things but not everything. They can't, based on our experiences, answer some of the questions that are raised in the minds of most users or frame something into a bigger context. How does some lines of code, for instance, actually work? 

That's our job during week one. Until then, please complete the objectives below. They'll provide a great introduction to JavaScript.  

## Objectives 
We've defined the following objectives: 

students will be able to...

1. [complete Code School's Introduction to JavaScript][1]
2. [complete Codey Academy's Introduction to JavaScript][2]

### 1 of 2: Code School
This company teaches technical topics through videos and interactive exercises. Their introduction to JavaScript is pretty good, and we would like you to complete the following two courses: [JavaScript Road Trip Part: 1][11] and [JavaScript Road Trip Part: 2][11]. 

Prior to enrolling in either course, use this free [two-day pass]. It will give you access to both courses. Please remember this is a two-day pass. After the second day, you'll no longer have access to the second course, which normally requires users to purchase a subscription. 

### 2 of 2: Code Academy
This company teaches users how to code through interactive exercises. Unlike Code School, you'll be spending the majority of your time typing code into their interactive console--and not watching videos. 

Please complete all the lessons in their [JavaScript Path][21]. 

# Conclusion
You've familiarized yourself with JavaScript. The two resources you've used have exposed you to two different teaching methodologies, one with videos and the other without. We hope that you've found one or both styles inline with your learning style. 

Let's move forward with the next step: [Chapter 5: jQuery][next-page].
